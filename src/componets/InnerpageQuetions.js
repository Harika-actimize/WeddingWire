          <Typography>
          You should start your venue search right after you have finalised your wedding date. Looking for the ideal wedding venue should be at the top of your wedding planning checklist. The most popular wedding venues are usually already booked 6-8 months in advance. If you are planning to get married on a Saaya date, you must book the wedding venue as soon as possible to ensure the venue is available for your wedding event. Booking in advance is also crucial when you are planning a destination wedding. Booking the venue plays a very important role in a destination wedding. Your entire wedding theme revolves around the aesthetics or location of the venue and your wedding designer makes some of the most important decisions based on that. This also helps you determine the final number of guests at your wedding, because guests usually RSVP depending on their possibility to travel to the destination wedding venue.
