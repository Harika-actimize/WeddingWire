<Typography><strong>Budget.</strong> One of the most deciding factors that will guide your venue search is your budget. Once you've got a clear idea of how much you can spend on the venue, you'll be able to narrow your search and take advantage of your precious time as you make visits.</Typography>

<Typography><strong>Availability.</strong>Once you have a wedding date, it's a good idea to ask if the venue is available on your wedding date. If they are available and you're clear on your priorities and the services they offer are suitable to you, ask how far in advance you can reserve the venue. Also ask if they do multiple weddings in one day.</Typography>
